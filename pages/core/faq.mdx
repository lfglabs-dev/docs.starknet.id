# Frequently asked questions

## What is Starknet ID?

Starknet ID is an identity and naming protocol built on top of Starknet that will permit you to register native .stark domains to Starknet (like .eth domains on ethereum). Starknet id have a different team than the Starknet/Starkware team and we're not affiliated with them.

## What is the difference between an identity and a domain?

An identity is an NFT that everyone can mint for free. It represents your Starknet passport or profile. You'll be able to link your profile data to this identity, for example you can link a .stark domain to the identity you just minted. If you do then you'll have an identity linked with a domain and it'll be usable in our [ecosystem apps](/ecosystem/integrations).

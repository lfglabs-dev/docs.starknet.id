# Subscription

The [Subscription](https://app.starknet.id/subscription) feature makes renewing your domain on the Starknet network easy and worry-free. It uses a special contract that automatically takes care of renewing your domain for you every year, so you don't have to remember to do it yourself or deal with any gas fees.

## Overview

Upon subscribing, Starknet ID promises the following:

- **No hidden fees**: You are only charged for the domain renewal. Transaction fees are taken care of by Starknet ID.
- **Full control**: You can deactivate this feature anytime you wish.
- **Maximum security**: The smart contract governing the process is immutable, which means it can't be altered, ensuring utmost reliability and security.

## Here's how it works

- Users authorize the smart contract to spend their funds for domain renewal.
- A Starknet ID-controlled bot interacts with this contract, using user funds to renew domains.
- Starknet ID pays Starknet gas fees for you.

## Key Guarantees

The smart contract provides the following guarantees:

1. **Dedicated Purpose**: Funds will only be used for renewing the domains you have specified.
2. **Charge Limit**: The maximum you can be charged is up to a predetermined limit set by you.
3. **Annual Renewal**: You can only be charged once in a year.
4. **Expiration-Driven Renewal**: Renewals will only happen if the domain is nearing expiration (less than a month left).

## Technical Insights

Let's delve into some technical aspects of the automatic renewal contract:

### 1. Renewal of Non-owned Domains

This feature lets you renew domains even if they're controlled by a smart contract. It's especially handy if you wish to maintain control over the renewal payments, while the domain is governed by a smart contract.

### 2. Multiple Spending Flows

Flexibility is at the core. You can set up multiple spending streams for various domains or even a single domain. However, even if you have multiple flows directed towards the same domain, it will be renewed only once a year, ensuring no overcharging.

### 3. Deactivation Parameters

To halt a spending flow, it's essential to use the account that initiated it. The original domain and `limit_price` must be provided. Events are emitted for users to easily track their allowances and manage them effortlessly.

### 4. Spending Capacity

The `limit_price`, or spending capacity, determines the amount deducted from your account. Even if the actual renewal is cheaper, the full `limit_price` amount will be used. Though there's a provision to reclaim overpaid funds, it's not a guaranteed feature and is generally discouraged for trivial amounts.

### 5. Admin Control

The contract is under the stewardship of an admin who can permanently halt all renewals â€” a measure in place for extreme scenarios, like a detected vulnerability. The admin also has authority over the renewer account â€“ the only account permitted to renew domains on behalf of others. This renewer needs StarknetID's trust, especially since it dictates the `tax_price`. If compromised, while the renewer would continue its function, the tax funds might not reach StarknetID.

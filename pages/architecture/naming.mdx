# Stark Naming System

The Stark Naming System relies on a naming smartcontract and an encoding system to support the resolving of unique names into data on Starknet.

## Encoding System

The encoding system converts a string, which represents a unique name, into a Starknet FieldElement. This conversion ensures names remain unique post encoding.

For detailed information on the encoding system, refer to the [Encoding System documentation](/architecture/naming/encoding.mdx).

## Naming Contract

The Naming Contract resolves an encoded domain to a Starknet identity and subsequently extracts the specified data.

### Starknet Native Address Resolution

For Starknet native addresses, specific resolution rules apply:

1. The system initially reads the 'starknet' field within the user namespace of the identity NFT.
2. If there's a direct mapping on the naming contract or a designated resolver that overrides this, that data is used.
3. In the absence of both, the NFT owner's address is returned.

### Reverse Resolving

Reverse resolving identifies the domain associated with an address by:

1. Querying the main Starknet ID associated with the user.
2. Returning the linked domain if it reciprocates the association and isn't overridden by a reverse mapping.

### Contract Interface Overview

The naming contract provides the following key functions:

- `resolve`: Converts a domain to its associated value for a given field.
- `domain_to_data`: Retrieves comprehensive data linked to a domain.
- `domain_to_id`: Translates a domain to its unique identifier.
- `domain_to_address`: Converts a domain to its corresponding contract address.
- `address_to_domain`: Resolves a contract address to its domain.
- `buy`: Acquire a new domain or reassign an existing one.
- `renew`: Extend the registration period of a domain.
- `transfer_domain`: Change the ownership of a domain.
- `reset_subdomains`: Reinitialize the subdomains of a domain.
- Administrative functions, including `set_admin`, `claim_balance`, `set_discount`, `set_pricing_contract`, `set_referral_contract`, and `upgrade`.

For a thorough understanding of the functions and their parameters, please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/starknet-id/naming).

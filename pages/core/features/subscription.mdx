# Domain Subscription

## Why Subscription?

The [Subscription](https://app.starknet.id/subscription) feature makes renewing your domain on the Starknet network easy and worry-free. It uses a special contract that automatically takes care of renewing your domain for you every year, so you don't have to remember to do it yourself or deal with any gas fees.

## How to enable subscription

**1️⃣ Go to your identity page & click on "enable subscription" button**
